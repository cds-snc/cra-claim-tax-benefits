# Running a manual deployment
Our app is pretty simple by design and we are keeping it that way as long as is justifiable. Accordingly, our deployment pipeline is pretty simple.

To deploy the app, you need to update the running container on our Azure App Service instance. (We‚Äôre using [Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/app-service/containers/): check out [the Docker Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-docker-go) if you want to get familiar).

Before we can update our container on Azure, we first need to upload a container somewhere. By default, App Service looks for containers on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but in our case, our Docker image is stored in [Azure Container Registry](https://portal.azure.com/#@122gc.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/fdf5725d-ea40-468e-81dd-aa1220910f75/resourceGroups/cdscracollab-innovation-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/claimtaxbenefits/repository).

## Prerequisites to manually deploy
Before you can update the live app, you‚Äôll need to be set up onCRA‚Äôs Azure portal and Azure Container Registry (ACR). Once you have accounts in Azure and access to ACR, you can deploy at will! (But probably you shouldn‚Äôt.)

### Get access to CDS‚Äô Azure Container Registry (ACR)
You‚Äôll need access to CDS‚Äô Azure Container Registry (ACR) to upload any container you build locally. If you haven‚Äôt signed up yet, get in touch with Paul Craig.

### Get access to CRA‚Äôs Azure portal
You‚Äôll need access to CRA‚Äôs Azure instance to update the container running at [https://claim-tax-benefits.azurewebsites.net/](https://claim-tax-benefits.azurewebsites.net/).

If you don‚Äôt have access ‚Äî again, ask Paul Craig.

## Steps to manually deploy
These are the steps from the point that you have a local version of the app on your laptop that you want to deploy.

The steps are:

1. [build a container](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/DEPLOY.md#build-a-container)
2. [tag your container](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/DEPLOY.md#tag-your-container)
3. [upload your container](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/DEPLOY.md#upload-your-container)
4. [update Azure App Service](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/DEPLOY.md#update-azure-app-service)

Our [`testBuildDeploy.yml`](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/.github/workflows/testBuildDeploy.yml) file goes through the deployment steps, so you can reverse engineer our deployment from that file, but let‚Äôs go through each one in more detail.

### Build a container
When you have a working version of the code on your laptop that you would like to deploy, you have to package it up as a container.

Make sure you have the [docker command line interface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) installed.

First, run `docker build` and pass in an optional `GITHUB_SHA_ARG`.

```
docker build -t base --build-arg GITHUB_SHA_ARG=<desired tag name> .
```

#### Optional env var
If a `GITHUB_SHA_ARG` is passed to the container when building, it will show up as a `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML on every page. This makes it easy to verify the currently-running version of the app by inspecting the HTML.

I would highly recommend passing a variable in ‚Äì it makes it dead easy to know when your new version is running in prod.

### Tag your container
Once built, tag your container before uploading it. The Azure Container Registry repo we‚Äôre uploading to is [`claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits`](https://portal.azure.com/#@122gc.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/fdf5725d-ea40-468e-81dd-aa1220910f75/resourceGroups/cdscracollab-innovation-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/claimtaxbenefits/repository), so you have to start the tag with that string. Tag it whatever you want ‚Äî preferably pick a unique tag, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Our automated deploys tag the containers with the current git SHA, but you‚Äôll have to type it in a few times, so it‚Äôs better to pick something more memorable.

[If you passed in a `GITHUB_SHA_ARG`](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/DEPLOY.md#optional-env-var), you should probably tag the container with the same string.

```
docker tag base claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:<desired tag name>
```

#### Run your container locally
While not strictly necessary, running your container locally before uploading is a good sense-check to make sure the container you just built works the way you expect.

To run locally, use the `docker run` command.

```
docker run -it -p 3005:3005 claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:<desired tag name>
```

Kill it with `ctrl+c` like you would with npm.

You can also run it in the background like so:

```
docker run -p 3005:3005 claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:<desired tag name>
```

### Upload your container
Once you have built, tagged, (and hopefully booted up) your container, it‚Äôs time to upload it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

```
docker push claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:<desired tag name>
```

Our container repository is [claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits](https://portal.azure.com/#@122gc.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/fdf5725d-ea40-468e-81dd-aa1220910f75/resourceGroups/cdscracollab-innovation-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/claimtaxbenefits/repository), so that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find your newly-uploaded container.

### Update Azure App Service

You can update the app on Azure either from your terminal using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) tool, or by logging into the online portal and updating it in the Azure GUI.

### Update Azure App Service through the CLI

Again, the command to update our app is the last step in the [`testBuildDeploy.yml`](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/.github/workflows/testBuildDeploy.yml) file, so if you are logged-in with Azure CLI, you should be able to update it with one line.

```
az webapp config container set --resource-group cdscracollab-innovation-rg --name claim-tax-benefits --docker-custom-image-name claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:<desired tag name>
```

It‚Äôll spend about a minute thinking about it and then return

- a big fat JSON response if everything worked out
- an error message if something is wrong

Usually takes about 2-4 minutes for the live app to switch over. If you built the container with a `GITHUB_SHA_ARG`, you can check the page `<head>` to see the currently running version. If you didn‚Äôt ‚Äî well, you should have.

### Update Azure App Service through the online portal

You can also update the app by using the user interface. For a one-off update, this is probably easier.

1. Visit [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. In the lefthand menu, click `App Services`
3. Once you see the App Services table, click `claim-tax-benefits`
4. Under the `Settings` heading, click `Container settings`
5. Locate the `Image and optional tag (eg 'image:tag')`. You should see a text field with the currently-running image (eg, `claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:{tag_name}`)
6. Update the tag name to your newly-uploaded tag (eg, `claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:<desired tag name>`)
7. Press the `Save` button
8. Wait for it to say `Settings updated successfully`

Usually takes about 2-4 minutes for the live app to switch over. If you built the container with a `GITHUB_SHA_ARG`, you can check the page `<head>` to see the currently running version. If you didn‚Äôt ‚Äî well, you should have.

### Creating a new Azure App Service for testing purposes

In case you don't want to override the live version of the app, you can spin a new instance of App Service for testing purposes by using the following command:

`az webapp create --resource-group cdscracollab-innovation-rg --plan alphaPlan --name claim-tax-benefits-{tag_name} --deployment-container-image-name claimtaxbenefits.azurecr.io/cra-claim-tax-benefits:{tag_name}`

You can then find the URL in the JSON response or in the Azure portal. URL should nornmally be `https://claim-tax-benefits-{tag_name}.azurewebsites.net`

When finished testing, you can delete the Azure App Service webapp using the following command:

`az webapp delete --resource-group cdscracollab-innovation-rg --name claim-tax-benefits-{tag_name}`

### All done!

You did it! üçïüçªüéâ

Congratulations, you are now a unicorn!
