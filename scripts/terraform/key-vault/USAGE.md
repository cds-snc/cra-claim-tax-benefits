# Background 
Terraform allows for writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in a Cloud provider agnostic way. CRA is opting for an hybrid Cloud approach (Azure and AWS), so coding our IaC with Terraform is a no brainer. Terraform allows to easily pivot scripts from a Cloud provider to another due to its abstract configuration language.

# What this script does
This script creates a new Azure Key Vault so we can store our secrets in it.

This script can also be used to destroy an existing Azure Key Vault.

# Variables
Variables can be defined in the `terraform.tfvars` file. Defaults are also defined in `create-key-vault.tf`

# Usage

## Create a new Azure Key Vault
Run `terraform init` to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

Edit `terraform.tfvars` to suit your needs and run `terraform plan` to have an overview of the changes to be applied. 

Then, run `terraform apply` to deploy the new changes.

Terraform will ask for a confirmation. Type `yes` to proceed.

## Delete an existing Azure Key Vault
Review `terraform.tfvars` since this is what is going to be targeted for the `destroy` operation.

Simply run `terraform destroy` to remove/delete/destroy any existing Azure App Service. 

Terraform will ask for a confirmation. Type `yes` to proceed.

# Known errors
If you got the following error message, that means the version of the azure provider you're using is outdated:

`Failed to instantiate provider "azure" to obtain schema: Incompatible API version with plugin. Plugin version: 4, Client versions: [5]`

Run this command to upgrade the azure provider: `terraform init -upgrade`
